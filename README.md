## Setup

```shell
brew install openjdk graphviz gnuplot
./install.sh
```

## Run

All challenges are run with the `run.sh` script. Each `maelstrom-XXX` folder contains the solution to one stage. You can run a single stage by deriving the challenge name from the folder name:

```shell
./run.sh echo
./run.sh unique-ids
# and so on
```
